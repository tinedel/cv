  Working as Lead Software Engineer and later Team Lead for a medical insurance company from USA.\newline{}
  My team was part of an agile release train which was creating an ETL system supporting complex user defined transformations including a dependency-tree based mapping of properties of arbitrary paths across the tree. We have developed the following subsystems:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Module to support error reporting and managing retries, both automatic and manual. Source systems were able to send json describing action they attempted, result and set up the policy for retries. The module was to provide UI and back-end to browse, correct and retry said actions.
  \item Module to verify correctness of data transfer between heterogeneous datastores, with main focus on comparing millions of rows of data between MongoDB and RDBMS (Oracle, DB2 and Postgres) with ability to extend to other kinds of data sources and to configure details of which columns should and should not be compared.
  \end{itemize} 
  Achievements:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In cooperation with the DevOps team aligned deployment of our components with the rest of the system. Made sure that Helm deployment works smoothly and is a one-button process.

  \item During business trip to client's office obtained knowledge on system, got to know key persons in the release train and shared this knowledge and connections locally improving communication.
  \item Managed cross-team support crew to cover the gap in testing support during USA night hours.
  \item Organized retrospectives in the team to timely identify blockers and bottlenecks, and give recognition to the team for achievements.
  \item Together with other lead engineer selected addition to the team who proved to be resourceful.
